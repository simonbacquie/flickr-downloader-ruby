For when you find out that someone from your highschool has posted hundreds of priceless photos of you and your friends from back then, and you have to have every single image, in full quality.

### Usage
`ruby scrape.rb [username]`

No Flickr API credentials are required. We're doing this the dirty way.

On first run, a `downloads` folder will be created. Within there, each user whose images you download will get a subfolder with all the images.

### About
This was just something I put together to try out Nokogiri. I originally wrote this in a combination of PHP and Node, but I'm liking this solution much better.
